# Using the same lists as we previously created in the using_lists.py example we will now go ahead and print out all items in the lists
# using for loops!

# Create a list of numbers:
numberslist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Print all items in list:
for item in list:
	print(item)

# Create a list of words:
wordlist = ["hello", "sir", "how are you doing?"]

# Print all items in list:
for word in wordlist:
	print(word)
	
# lists can contain several different datatypes:
my_list = [1,2,3, "Hello Sir!"]

for item in my_list:
	print(item)
