#Example 1:
# Create a list of numbers (integers in this case):
numberslist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#Print first item in numberslist: (python counts 0 as the first item.)
print(numberslist[0])
>>> 1


#Example 2:
# Create a list of words (strings):
wordlist = ["hello", "Sir", "how are you doing?"]
print(wordlist[0])
>>> "hello"

#Print all words:
print(wordlist[0], wordlist[1], wordlist[2])
>>> "Hello Sir how are you doing?"

#Example 3:
# lists can contain several different datatypes, here we have both integer and string datatypes in the same list.
my_list = [1,2,3, "Hello Sir!"]
print(my_list[0], my_list[3])
>>> 1 "Hello Sir!"
